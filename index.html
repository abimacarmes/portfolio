        <p>
          I've always been interested in web development but never had the guts to go for it until now! My first coding experience was with a singular course in university and I loved the process and that it felt like an intersting puzzle.
          <br><br>
          When I started working, I tried to apply as many of my skills as possible to automate my tasks and loved doing that as well. I love helping out my team by fixing any of their problems and keeping manual work to a minimum.
          <br><br>
          I found Bloc when I was researching crash courses and it appealed to me because I could fit it into pockets of time throughout my days and whenever I need to on a weekend. If I have a soccer game or want to go out for dinner, I can fit in my coding in these pockets while still being able to enjoy hobbies!

        <!-- Lists of hobbies for a personal touch with a photo.-->
        <p>
          In whatever spare time I can find, and when we aren't in the middle of a pandemic, some of my hobbies include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Traveling</li>
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>Soccer</li>
          <li>Dogsitting any puppy I can get my hands on!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the photo I took while traveling in a remote part of Japan:
        </p>
        <img src="images/foggyMountainsJapan.jpg" width="100" alt="Photo of foggy mountains in Japan.">
