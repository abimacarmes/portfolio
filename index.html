          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I've always been interested in web development but never had the guts to go for it until now! My first coding experience was with a singular course in university and I loved the process and that it felt like an intersting puzzle.
          <br><br>
            When I started working, I tried to apply as many of my skills as possible to automate my tasks and loved doing that as well. I love helping out my team by fixing any of their problems and keeping manual work to a minimum.
          <br><br>
            I found Bloc when I was researching crash courses and it appealed to me because I could fit it into pockets of time throughout my days and whenever I need to on a weekend. If I have a soccer game or want to go out for dinner, I can fit in my coding in these pockets while still being able to enjoy hobbies!
          <br><br>
            I'm still learning and trying to figure out what I'd like to be doing with myself in the future. Currently, I think I'm leaning towards back-end development and will continue to update as I narrow my scope.

          <div class = "item">
            <h2> Outside the Flexbox</h2>
            <p>
              In whatever spare time I can find, and when we aren't in the middle of a pandemic, some of my hobbies include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Traveling</li>
              <li>Photography</li>
              <li>Soccer</li>
              <li>Dogsitting any puppy I can get my hands on!</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class = "double-item">
            <p>
              For example, the photo I took while traveling in a remote part of Japan:
            </p>
            <img src="images/foggyMountainsJapan.jpg" width="600" alt="Photo of foggy mountains in Japan.">

            Description that explains what the app does, who it's for, why you built it.
